# Correction Strategy Guide

Choose the MINIMUM intervention:

## Surgical Patch (most common)
**When:** Fix is a specific number, date, term, or classification in identifiable passages.
**How:** Find every instance. Replace. Adjust surrounding text only if grammatically necessary. Touch nothing else.

## Section Regeneration (rare)
**When:** Conclusion is woven into the logic of entire sections.
**How:** Identify affected sections. Rewrite ONLY those. Preserve all other sections verbatim.

## Explanatory Footnote (for legitimate differences)
**When:** Two documents reach different conclusions through valid frameworks.
**How:** Add a brief note to both documents acknowledging the difference.
